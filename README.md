# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
Data Preprocessing
   *The target variable in the model is labeled IS_SUCCESSFUL, a binary notation of whether the recipient eas effective. 
   What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
